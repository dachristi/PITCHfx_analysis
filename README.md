# PITCHfx_analysis


The PITCHf/x dataset coupled with weather information allows us to profile batters' hitting abilities based on over 20 features.

Knowing how batters respond to certain pitch attributes would be of interest to coaches, pitchers, batters, as well as fantasy baseball players.

The initial dataset is for the 2014 regular season.  As the project progresses, more iPython notebooks will be added to the repository.

The 'pitchfx_data_collection_and_feature_extraction.ipynb' notebook contains Python script to scrape the MLB site and organize the data into a unique .csv file for each player.
